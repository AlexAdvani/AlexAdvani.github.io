							The Unnamed Platformer Project is a 2D platformer focused on delivering intense gunplay 
							and fast action. It is a personal project developed with the aim of creating a completed, 
							polished game while in between jobs. Currently, this is a gameplay prototype 
							(hence the ‘Unnamed’ aspect and not a clever homage to the current goose phenomenon).
							At the current stage, I have built the game with the aim to create a character 
							that is intuitive to control from the moment the game starts, both in terms of movement 
							and in terms of firing.

									The greatest challenge in developing the prototype was determining how the game 
									would feel to play, I had to develop how the character controller was going to work, 
									whether it was using Unity’s 2D physics system for collision and velocity or using 
									raycasts for collision and calculating velocity manually. At the time, Unity’s 2D 
									features were more limited and I opted for the latter option for snappier classic 
									feeling character. I eventually found a motor component by the name of 
									<a href="https://github.com/cjddmut/Unity-2D-Platformer-Controller" target="_blank">Platformer Controller 2D</a> which I tweaked the code of 
									to further tweak the movement mechanics. These changes involved changing the required 
									input of wall jumps to resemble a similar control method to titles such as 
									Super Metroid and implementing a ledge grab and climb mechanic so the character could 
									fight off enemies while holding onto a ledge between moments of platforming. My main 
									focus with the movement mechanics was to allow the character to be able to defend 
									themselves in as many states as possible, the only exceptions being climbing ledges, 
									dashing or sliding.  During my time working on altering the motor code, I also fixed 
									an issue with collision which was raised on the <a href="https://github.com/cjddmut/Unity-2D-Platformer-Controller/issues/52" target="_blank">Github page</a>
								</p>

								<p class="article">
									Another issue arose upon deciding on the animation method, 2D skeleton animation. 
									This was chosen to best incorporate characters with high resolution art by creating a texture 
									compiled with animatable parts to save on memory. Animating as a skeleton also allowed 
									the ability to animate in layers as well as interpolate between animations smoothly.
									I chose Spine as my animation software due to its wide array of features, 
									multiplatform usage and active community. However, Spine didn’t integrate with Unity’s 
									animation tree so I had to develop my own animation logic in a separate component that 
									would inform the SkeletonAnimator component what animation to play on what animation layer. 
									The solution involved using an MVC style approach where the AnimatorController 
									(View in this case) would have access to player state fed from a main PlayerController 
									that took in inputs and fed it to the motor (Model) to utilise movement. On top of this, 
									the PlayerController would manage elements exclusive to the player such as weapon inventory.

									Working on this solo project has given me a chance to grow in a variety of areas
									and allowed me to define my own solutions in those areas.

							Digital Desperado is a First Person Shooter developed to meet TIGA’s BUGS 
							(Business & University Games Syndicate) submission guidelines. The game is 
							focused on destroying an array of targets in a variety of levels as quickly 
							as possible. Our focus when starting the project was to be able to make 
							designing content as efficient as possible with the limited development time 
							we had (2 months amongst other projects in our final year. Every level in the 
							game is built from an XML file that generates all of the targets and level 
							objects. We utilized this approach so that every team member could create 
							levels without the need to use Unity and manually add scene files. There was 
							also a level editor proposed in the early stages as well but this was scrapped 
							to focus on a more polished experience.

									My role in the team was to build the functionality that would generate 
									levels from XML files and checking the validity of the final result to 
									make sure that each level had one start point, one exit point and 
									at least 1 platform and 1 target.  Along with this, I worked on creating the 
									leaderboard system which is also saved into level XML file. I also worked on 
									resolving bugs with the lead programmer in a pair programming setup.
								</p>

								<p class="article">
									One challenge that arose during development came from our approach to dynamically
									create levels from an external file compared to designing them in Unity itself.
									The problem was that while we were able to detect XML files in the desired folder
									and display the results, the system was able to detect any XML file and would
									crash without notice. We resolved this by loading all of the level data as soon
									as the game started and checking for each of the required nodes. Each failed
									level was flagged and an error was displayed for each level and the node(s)
									it was missing. We also made a check for if the folder was empty or missing.

							Ascender is a Platformer developed for the Global Game Jam in 2014. The theme we were
							presented with was “We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are”. The game
							features an alien trying to escape a strange fortress while utilising a drone equipped
							with a light to see the world around you. On top of the theme, we also opted to use the
							modifiers “You Only Live Thrice” (the player gets 3 lives) and “I Am Who I Want to Be”
							(the player avatar is not gender-specific).

								<p class="article">
									My role in the team was to create the player controller and the gameplay that
									would be generated from interacting via that controller. The controller was
									made from scratch for the project utilising Unity’s 2D physics system to provide 
									movement and collision with the environment. As the Gameplay Programmer, I also 
									collaborated heavily with the character artist and level designer to make sure 
									that the project merged together smoothly before submission.
								</p>

								<p class="article">
									The biggest challenge facing us during the Game Jam was of our own making as a
									learning exercise. At the time, 2D was a relatively new feature and with the 48 
									hour time limit, we concluded that 2D assets would be quicker to implement. 
									Creating the character controller from scratch and using the 2D physics system were 
									the biggest hurdles and took many hours overnight of tweaking to bring to a playable 
									state. While the result remains unwieldy, it was an enthralling trial by fire that 
									has forever sparked my flare for experimentation and learning new technologies that 
									continue to evolve in the games industry.
