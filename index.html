									The greatest challenge (as with any 2D platformer) was the character movement
									and game feel. I had to develop how the character controller was going to work, 
									whether it was using Unity’s 2D physics system for collision and velocity or using 
									raycasts for collision and calculating velocity manually. At the start of the project in 2017,
									Unity’s 2D features were more limited and I opted for the latter option for snappier classic 
									feeling character. 
								</p>
								<p class="article">
									I eventually found a motor component by the name of 
									<a href="https://github.com/cjddmut/Unity-2D-Platformer-Controller" target="_blank">Platformer Controller 2D</a>
									that needed some tweaking to match my needs. These changes involved changing the required 
									input of wall jumps to resemble a similar control method to titles such as Super Metroid 
									as well as a implementing a ledge grab / climb mechanic. Due to the use of single component 
									for such a complicated motor, finding the appropriate code and changing it was much more difficult than originally I estimated.
									During my time working on altering the motor code, I also fixed an issue with collision which
									was raised on the <a href="https://github.com/cjddmut/Unity-2D-Platformer-Controller/issues/52" target="_blank">Github page</a>
								</p>
								<p class="article">
									My main focus with the movement mechanics was to allow the character to be able to defend themselves 
									in as many states as possible so the gunplay has been built to be available in most cases, the only
									exceptions being climbing ledges, dashing or sliding.
								</p>

								<p class="article">
									Another issue arose upon deciding on the animation method, 2D skeleton animation. 
									This was chosen to best incorporate characters with high resolution art as well as the 
									ability to animate in layers and interpolate between animations smoothly.
									I chose <a href="http://esotericsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Spine</a> as my animation software 
									due to its wide array of features, multiplatform usage and active community. 
								</p>
								<p class="article">
									However, Spine didn’t integrate with Unity’s animation tree so I had to develop my own animation 
									logic in a separate component that would inform the SkeletonAnimator component what animation to 
									play on what animation layer. The solution involved using an MVC style approach where the AnimatorController 
									(View in this case) would have access to player state fed from a main PlayerController 
									that took in inputs and fed it to the motor (Model) to utilise movement. On top of this, 
									the PlayerController would manage elements exclusive to the player such as weapon inventory.
								</p>

								<h2 class="align-left">Current Work in Progress</h2>

								<p class="article">
									After finishing the last build, I have been focusing on improving the art and animation of
									the main character. This started with a final version of the character being designed:

							Digital Desperado is a First Person Shooter developed to meet TIGA’s BUGS 
							(Business & University Games Syndicate) submission guidelines. The game is 
							focused on destroying an array of targets in a variety of levels as quickly 
							as possible. Our focus when starting the project was to be able to make 
							designing content as efficient as possible with the limited development time 
							we had (2 months amongst other projects in our final year. 
						</p>
						<p class="article">
							Every level in the 
							game is built from an XML file that generates all of the targets and level 
							objects. We utilized this approach so that every team member could create 
							levels without the need to use Unity and manually add scene files. There was 
							also a level editor proposed in the early stages as well but this was scrapped 
							to focus on a more polished experience.
						</p>


						<div class="collapse" id="digital-desperado-collapse">
							<div class="card card-body">
								<h2 class="align-left">My Contribution</h2>
								<p class="article">
									My role in the team was to build the functionality that would generate 
									levels from XML files and checking the validity of the final result to 
									make sure that each level had one start point, one exit point and 
									at least 1 platform and 1 target.  Along with this, I worked on creating the 
									leaderboard system which is also saved into level XML file. I also worked on 
									resolving bugs with the lead programmer in a pair programming setup.
								</p>

								<p class="article">
									One challenge that arose during development came from our approach to dynamically
									create levels from an external file compared to designing them in Unity itself. 
									The problem was that while I was able to detect XML files in the desired folder and 
									display the results, the system was able to detect any XML file and would crash 
									without notice. I resolved this by loading all of the level data as soon as the game 
									started and checking for each of the required nodes. Each failed level was flagged and
									an error was displayed for each level and the node(s) it was missing. I also made a 
									check for if the folder was empty or missing.
								</p>

								<p class="article">
									To further ease level creation, I did attempt to create a level editor. The editor 
									would have been a separate application during development with the goal of adding it 
									to the game in the final stages of development. Despite how well the level generation 
									worked, I underestimated the amount of time required to create a fully fledged level 
									editor, even for a small game. In the week that I dedicated to the editor, I managed to 
									implement the ability to create platforms, a file dialog to set a file destination and 
									the ability to save the final XML. The main challenge was developing the editor to be 
									able to catch errors without crashing and accurately inform the user of the problem. 
									The decision to scrap the editor came down to the complexity of the feature and time 
									requirements for the project.

							Ascender is a Platformer developed for the Global Game Jam in 2014. The theme we were
							presented with was “We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are”. The game
							features an alien trying to escape a strange fortress while utilising a drone equipped
							with a light to see the world around you. On top of the theme, we also opted to use the
							modifiers “You Only Live Thrice” (the player gets 3 lives) and “I Am Who I Want to Be”
							(the player avatar is not gender-specific).

									My role in the team was to create the player controller and the gameplay that
									would be generated from interacting via that controller. The controller was
									made from scratch for the project utilising Unity’s 2D physics system to provide 
									movement and collision with the environment. As the Gameplay Programmer, I also 
									collaborated heavily with the character artist and level designer to make sure 
									that the project merged together smoothly before submission.
								</p>

								<p class="article">
									The biggest challenge facing us during the Game Jam was of our own making as a
									learning exercise. At the time, 2D was a relatively new feature and with the 48 
									hour time limit, we concluded that 2D assets would be quicker to implement. 
									Creating the character controller from scratch and using the 2D physics system were 
									the biggest hurdles and took many hours overnight of tweaking to bring to a playable 
									state. While the result remains unwieldy, it was an enthralling trial by fire that 
									has forever sparked my flare for experimentation and learning new technologies that 
									continue to evolve in the games industry.
								</p>

								<p class="article">
									Overall, this was an interesting chance to experiment with creating 2D movement without
									using premade code under a tight deadline.
